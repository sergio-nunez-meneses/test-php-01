# test-php-01

Final project for the online course "PHP 1" offered by the Public Libraries of Santiago de Chile.
The aim was to code a program that handles the database of a factory.
To do so, different PHP scripts had to be coded in order to complete the initial program given by the tutors (CSS stylesheet and HTML tags), run the program on the navigator, and deliver it.

The database has 3 tables:

Productos: Information of the factory products.
Personal: Information on the workers with positions "Admin" and "Bodega".
Entregas: Information of the deliveries that are made.

Students had to : 

1. Code files "conexion.php" and "sesion.php".
2. Complete files "principalAdmin.php", "principalBodega.php", "eliminar_personal.php", "mod_personal.php", "mod_producto.php", "eliminar_producto.php", "realizar_entrega.php" and "entregas.php".
3. Code file "registro.php". Complete files "crear_personal.php" and "agregar_producto.php".
4. Code files "validar.php" and "salir.php".

Given that the PHP version used on the course corresponds to an older one, my goal now is to update the entire program to the PDO syntax.
